# DS_Assignment-2-depthmap
Given the dataset, the problem can be formulated as a regression problem where the goal is to predict the height of children using their corresponding depthmap images.

Approach:
1. We use Support Vector Regression to solve this problem.
The score of the pipeline is 1 (100%)
2. We use a deep learning approach to solve this problem.First we use We will use a neural network (NN) to extract features from the depthmap images and try to predict the height of the children.
After that we use a CNN based approach to predict height.
Mean Absolute Error for NN is around1 10 and that for CNN is around 11.
3. We used a KNN approach to solve this problem.
Root Mean Square Eroor for k = 1 to 5 is 0.
